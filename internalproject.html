            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>After we conduct researchs, we gather findings that leads to several hypotheses for users to hinder from increasing Average Basket Size in Orami services. From our researchs, users experienced slow response from the e-commerce platform can positively confirm why user usually feel stressed and unfinished thier product findings process. In other field we make hypothesis there are problems related to brand positioning for Orami. It's take from the popularity of the brand itself, its still very unknown for general Indonesian.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>We done problems & solutions prioritization until we come up to conclusion that we decided to choose Product Recommendation Feature as product feature we propose in this project. We done researchs for references and analyze existing product recommendation feature in Orami for developing our Product Recommendation Feature. From prioritization we get that Product Recommendation feature are the most wanted feature from users perspective taken from Kano Model and the most impactful feature and worth to effort from RICE Framework. Later then, we design the User Flow, PRD, and Prototype.</p>
