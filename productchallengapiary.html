            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>Product challenge is an Apiary Academy program for product manager to practice and participate their product management skills. In this project I joined Apiary X Telkom to develop Telkom branch company, Agree. Agree is a startup focusing in agriculture, including harvest, forestry, fisheries, and farm. Services that Agree already developed, consist of AgreePartner, AgreeModal, AgreeMart, AgreeMarket, AgreePedia, dan AgreeSmartFarming. In this challenge participants mandated to developed thier new developed service, which is AgreePedia.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>In this challenge Telkom already give participants brief requirements to complete, such as market sizing, potential features, and metrics to measured performance. I used several method for my further research.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>I recommend several features to develop from my analysis, then followed with reasonable metrics to measured performance. I focused on 1 feature to be develop that is Shared Article Feature. Share Article Feature is feature that enable user to share article that AgreePedia created they feel usefull for others around their circle or community.</p>
            <p>Idea behind this suggestion is to boost popularity and spread service awareness among community. Beside that reason why I've choosed this feature is taken from my simple effort impact prioritization, it's considered to the most effective among other proposed features.</p>
            <p>Metrics that I included : numbers of shared, number of user view /article, number of click links from shared contents through social media, and useful rate. For further explanation about metrics they are explained in full document.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>First I do analysis with the demanded service, I find AgreePedia still in their early development stage. I'm using several method to approach problems and develop solutions, such as market sizing, user persona, user journey, prioritization, prototyping, user flow, user stories, and metrics.
